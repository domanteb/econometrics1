## MAPS IN R

With R it is possible to download and process information from OpenStreetMap. The following map was for example generated based on OpenStreetMap data. The package geosmdata2 was used to download the information. The package is a R-wrapper for the Overpass API.

The map shows the different kind of generators located in Germany. It is visible that wind generators are by far the most used generator type in Germany. The visualisation was done using the Software as a Service CartoDB. The example data is available here.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
##IMPORT SHAPEFILES

**Shapefiles** are very important to display data in maps. There are several sources for shapefiles available. And we do have several possibilities to import shapefiles to R.

One possibility is to use the **readShapePoly** function from library **maptools**. A better alternative is the function **readOGR** from library **rgdal**.
